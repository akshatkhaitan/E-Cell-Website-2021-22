        The Entrepreneurship Cell at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus strives to
        stimulate and encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, both within
        BITS Hyderabad and beyond. We endeavour to help aspiring entrepreneurs
        overcome any hurdles they face and support them in any way possible,
        including by connecting them to mentors and investors and providing any
        other support they need. Apart from this, we attempt to enhance the
        culture of entrepreneurship and invention. From hosting talks with the
        leaders of various industries, conducting workshops to propagate skills
        related to entrepreneurship to organizing events and competitions that
        enable participants to showcase their skills, E-Cell aims to build a
        community of innovation and excellence.
