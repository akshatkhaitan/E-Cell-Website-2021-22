The word &#39;entrepreneur&#39; is a loanword from French and has Latin origins with the merger of two words _&#39;entre&#39; - which means to swim out_ and _&#39;prends&#39; - which means to grasp, understand or capture._ This simple merger of these two words perfectly encapsulates the meaning of what being an entrepreneur is, an adventurer who chooses to take on the challenge of starting their ventures and sail through countless unpredictable challenges.

The questions like - When did entrepreneurship begin and Who was the first entrepreneur are all rendered futile as Steve Jobs was an entrepreneur, so were Henry Ford and Walt Disney. But so were the merchants and traders or the first harvesters of crops or creators of the wheel. It is evident from this that entrepreneurship has existed in some form for as long as humans have walked this Earth.

Entrepreneurship has grown a lot with time; however, a few things have remained the same among most entrepreneurs. The _Entrepreneurial Spirit_ may sound like an intangible asset. Still, attributes like focus and diligence, along with the ability to solve problems, to show creativity and invention â€“ are things that simply cannot be taught in any classroom. Without these, startups would never get off the ground.

Today, when we talk about entrepreneurship, the first things that come to mind are giant tech empires. We usually overlook the diverse and rich scope that entrepreneurship has in its present and its great past.

The constants in entrepreneurship can be evidently seen on comparing the past of entrepreneurship to the present.

Today, entrepreneurship has become more diverse while effective as well in targeting the right consumer base. Technology has become an ally, which makes it more efficient and expands its capabilities. With improved access to resources and essential knowledge, technological entrepreneurship has progressed rapidly. All startups, tech or non-tech, utilize specialised tools like social media, apps and websites. Even smaller players and bootstrapped startups have embraced this move to digitalisation and automation.

Companies with an online presence now have a significant advantage over those with a traditional distribution avenue. Social commerce businesses, where the entire process from product discovery to check-out takes place on social media have recently gained traction with the increasing popularity of various social media platforms and networking websites. According to a Bain &amp; Company report, social commerce in India will be worth up to US$20 billion by 2025 and up to US$70 billion by 2030.

There has also been an increase in social entrepreneurship in recent years. Social entrepreneurship focuses on the social and environmental impact of ideas and initiatives rather than financial gains. Such ventures can be classified as NGOs (CRY, Goonj), revenue-generating social ventures (Milaap), hybrid ventures (Industree Crafts) and social enterprises (Vaatsalya Hospitals). The need to give back to society and abolish social inequities has led to more and more start-ups coming up in this domain. Through increased CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) initiatives, corporations fulfil their social responsibilities, integrating such concerns into their operations.

Many aspiring people are changing their ideas into reality. We have seen the rise of many successful startups in recent times, which, along with its success, contributes to the nation&#39;s economic growth.

In India, the growth of entrepreneurship can be divided into three main phases, business to consumer(B2C), Fintech, and Software as a Service(SaaS). India is rapidly evolving from an emerging market to a robust startup ecosystem.

This now leads the conversation to the future. The entire model for global entrepreneurship is evolving at speed. In the near future, we can see that entrepreneurship will be defined broadly by the growth and expansion of the digital world.

The digitalisation of different avenues of life is already emerging as a trend in today&#39;s post-pandemic society. The pandemic has created opportunities for entrepreneurs and changed the mode of operation worldwide. It has given rise to location-independent solutions and improved flexibility of workspace, including working from home.

Changes in regulations and technology significantly affect the way businesses operate. As machines become more efficient, it looks likely that those who have jobs will have to be entrepreneurs at some point. Instead of relying on an employer to hire you and give you a job, people will simply make their own. The future will see small but highly skilled teams, which will eventually raise the demand for active learning, stress tolerance, and flexibility.

It is hard to see beyond technology as the driving force in the industry. Still, no matter what the future holds, the foundational structures of entrepreneurship will not change. For that reason, entrepreneurs will continue to have a special place in society and will continue to be at the forefront of innovation.
